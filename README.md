- Character Options: The generator allows you to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in your password.
- Real-Time Password Generation: As you adjust the options, the password is generated instantly, giving you immediate feedback.
- Error Handling: The app includes validation to ensure that passwords are between 8 and 10 characters long and that at least one character set is selected.
